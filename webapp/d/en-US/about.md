My Fidelity was created to be a central hub for all Stoic Dreams' API services and content management. Over the years, we have matured our services and concepts. And we have decided that for our next generation of features currently in development, that we want to share and offer them as BAAS (Backend-As-A-Service) solutions to other developers and companies outside of Stoic Dreams.
